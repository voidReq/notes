- CPU
	- ALU: Performs operations (arithmetic/logical)
	- CU: Decodes instructions
	- Registers: Fastest storage locations
- RAM
	- Store instructions/data
	- Byte addressable
	- Volatile
- I/O
	- External communication
- Bus system
	- Data bus: transfers data
	- Address buss: Carries memory addresses
	- Control buss: Control signals (r/w/x, etc.)

- Registers: Temporary data during computation
	- General purpose:
		- Store data
	- Program counter/Instruction pointer:
		- Store address of next instruct to execute
	- Stack pointer:
		- Points to top of stack
	- Status/Flags Register:
		- Condition codes (0, carry, overflow, etc)

- Instruction Cycle
	- Fetch:
		- Reads instruction using instruction pointer
		- Instruction loaded into instruction register
		- Instruction pointer incremented
	- Decode:
		- CU decides on an operation to perform
		- CU decides which registers/memory locations in use
	- Execute:
		- ALU executes
		- Results stored in destination
		- Flags updated
- Processors access one byte at a time
