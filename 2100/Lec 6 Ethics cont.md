# DEBUGGER

- Set a break point, and run and debug
- "Run and debug"
    - Creates run and debug menu, with call stack as well as variable values
- If you use `__repr__` method, it manages how values are displayed
- 6 dots: drag
- Arrow right: til next break
- Step over (if a fn call, exec fn)
- Step into (enter fn, runs only first line)
- Step out (leave fn)


- Can call fn in a separate file in such a way that the bug will appear.
